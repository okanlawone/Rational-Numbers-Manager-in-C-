# Rational Numbers Manager in C++

This project is a simple yet powerful application developed using C++ that helps users to work with rational numbers. The program provides users with the ability to enter, manage, and manipulate rational numbers in various ways, making it easier to perform operations on these numbers.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need a compiler capable of compiling C++ code. This project was developed using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), but it should work with any standard C++ compiler.

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (GCC recommended)
- Terminal/command-line interface

### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.


## Running the Program


The program will prompt you to enter a series of rational numbers, which are numbers that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers. After you enter the rational numbers, the program will display them, sort them in descending order, and then display the sorted numbers.

## Built With

- C++

## Concepts Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Operator Overloading
- Arrays
- User-Defined Functions
- Standard Template Library (STL)
